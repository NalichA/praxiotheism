    "questions": {
      "whatIsPraxiotheism": {
        "question": "What is Praxiotheism?",
        "answer": "Praxiotheism is a meta-religious framework where you become a Creator of Gods rather than a worshipper. It's based on the principle that God is a mirror of what's inside us—not a cosmic big shot out there, but a reflection of our choices, actions, and perspectives. The term combines 'praxis' (action) and 'theos' (God), meaning 'Divinity through Action.' You don't bow down to a deity; you become one when you choose, reflect, and shape the world around you."
      },
      "howToBecomeCreator": {
        "question": "How do I become a Creator of Gods?",
        "answer": "Start with Conscious Faith Design—build a God that works for you. Define their traits, then start the conversation. You're not worshipping; you're designing and collaborating with the divine. Practice the Daily Choice Ritual: every morning, ask yourself, 'What slice of the divine am I firing up today?' Choose which facet of God you want to activate and embody in your actions. The only entry requirement? Acting with awareness and keeping it real with yourself."
      },
      "whatAreFacets": {
        "question": "What are facets of the divine?",
        "answer": "Facets are different aspects or qualities of the divine that you can activate and embody. Think of God as an infinite crystal with endless facets—each religion focuses on one facet, swearing it's the whole truth. In Praxiotheism, you recognize that every religion's truth is real, but it's just a slice. You can be a Faceteer, diving into different facets like Mercy, Justice, Rebellion, or Silence. What's 'good' for one facet might be 'evil' for another—the key is alignment of choice, action, and meaning."
      },
      "howRelatesToOtherReligions": {
        "question": "How does Praxiotheism relate to other religions?",
        "answer": "Praxiotheism isn't fighting old faiths—it's a meta-language that lets you see how religions tick. Every religion is a mythological operating system. You can practice Deep Hospitality (trying on traditions as experiments), Symbolic Integration (weaving archetypes into your model), or Gnostic Takedown (breaking down dogmas that block free engagement). A Praxiotheist might say: 'Judaism gave me structure, Hinduism gave me depth, Christianity gave me heart, Islam gave me fire. But I built the crystal myself.'"
      },
      "whatIsFacetTensionSymbol": {
        "question": "What is the Facet Tension Symbol?",
        "answer": "The Facet Tension Symbol is a mark of clashing opposites—point up for aspiration, point down for diving deep, with a horizontal line between them as the charged moment of choice. It's a reminder that every action lives at the crossroads of dualities. We act in the now, holding conflict and turning it into strength. It echoes lightning (like Zeus or Thor) or Shiva's mark in tantric traditions—a universal sign of power, transition, and inner tension."
      },
      "howToPracticeEthicalDecisionMaking": {
        "question": "How do I practice ethical decision-making in Praxiotheism?",
        "answer": "Use the Ethical Pentagon—a five-point check: Vector (where was the action headed?), Awareness (did I know what I was doing?), Context (what was the situation?), Conflict (which facets clashed?), and Echo (what did this ripple into me and others?). After big moves, practice the Facet Feedback Ritual: ask which facet you activated, whether you were aligned in thought, word, and action, and where you slipped. Good isn't doing the 'right' thing—it's choosing your truth and sticking to it."
      },
      "whatHappensAfterDeath": {
        "question": "What happens after death in Praxiotheism?",
        "answer": "Death is a shift from solid to fluid—not a cancellation, but a melting of form, a return to the crystal as a freer substance. You don't end up 'somewhere'—you become what you've built. If you balanced Light and Shadow in life, you keep navigating that tension. If you were stuck on fear or control, your afterlife config is tight and repetitive. It's not judgment; it's resonance. You can practice the Letter of the Eternal Facet—writing down the facet you want to carry through death as a magical contract."
      },
      "canIFollowOtherReligions": {
        "question": "Can I be a Praxiotheist and still follow other religions?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Praxiotheism is designed as a meta-framework that works alongside other traditions. You can be a Faith Architect, intentionally building your own belief system by weaving different traditions together. Use religions as mythological operating systems—take what works, leave what doesn't. The key is staying aware that every religion is just a facet of the same crystal. Honor the facet, but don't build walls around it. Look through it, and you'll see the rest."
      },
      "whatAreDifferentRoles": {
        "question": "What are the different roles in Praxiotheism?",
        "answer": "There are several roles you can embody: Creator of Gods (design and collaborate with the divine), Faceteer (explore different facets), Faith Architect (build your own belief system), Guide (help others spot their facets), Theomechanic (use tech as divine masks), Tension Holder (balance opposites), Reality Modeler (craft existence maps), and Facet Shaper (hone specific qualities). These aren't hierarchical—they're different ways of engaging with the divine. You might embody multiple roles or switch between them."
      },
      "howToStartPracticing": {
        "question": "How do I start practicing Praxiotheism?",
        "answer": "Begin with the initiation ritual: Create your first personal God model, lock it in, and work it long enough to see real-world results. Start with Conscious Faith Design—build a God that works for you. Practice the Daily Choice Ritual every morning. Do Archetype Work—read myths as inner roadmaps. Keep a Model-Sharpening journal. Remember: Faith isn't about bowing down; it's about locking in on reality. God's not the finish line; God's the playground of possibilities where you pick your game."
